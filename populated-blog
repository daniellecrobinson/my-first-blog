      <h2><a href="">Project strategy</a></h2>
      <p>I've been trying to improve my strategy and get out of some project planning habits. This exercise pulls from Amira's <a href= "https://medium.com/read-write-participate/women-web-strong-7e50f123311e#.4gds7zlt4">Women and Web session at Mozfest </a>, Open Canvas, Open Leadership materials, and conversations with my fellowship mentor Robin Champieux. I hope this exercise will help you with strategic planning for your projects!</p>

      <h2><a href="">Outcomes</a></h2>
      <p>*Outcomes* are the change the project is intended to realize, as well as significant indicators of progress along the way. Separate outcomes from *outputs*. For example, running a basic markdown class is an *output*, while students learning to write in markdown and incorporating it into their workflows is an *outcome*.</p>
